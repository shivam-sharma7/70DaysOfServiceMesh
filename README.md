## Welcome to #70DaysOfServiceMesh!!!
Inspired by Michael Cades' #90DaysOfDevOps and his ask for me to participate in his 2023 iteration to discuss 7 Days of Service Mesh, I decided to create a #70DaysOfServiceMesh.

70 Days of Service Mesh allows me to dig into plenty of areas to help myself (and others) better understand the inner workings of a service mesh. Some days will be a bit of a mini blogpost while other days might be very tutorial oriented.

Also, these are 70 sequential days of service mesh. It means I'll spend about day focusing on one topic. Hopefully I wrap this up within 90 days because 2023 is starting to look BUSY.

In this repo, we'll dig into a structured and iterative approach to learning Service Mesh.

## The topics covered in this repository:
- What is a Service Mesh
- Comparison of Service Meshes
- Networking Recap
- Kubernetes Recap
- Envoy
- Traffic Engineering
- Application Resiliency
- Observability
- Security and AuthN/AuthZ
- Istio Ambient Mesh
- Expanded areas of Istio

### The table below outlines what we'll cover in 70 Days of Service Mesh, with Istio being the main focus.

**Note** Some of this is subject to change.
